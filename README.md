# ArjunSProjectCollection
Welcome to my curated GitHub Repository containing my favorite Python projects from Northeastern Data Science Coursework. This portfolio is intended to showcase the variety of skills I have developed in data analysis, machine learning, web development and object oriented programming.

## About this Repo
This portfolio is structured to be:
- **Intuitive to navigate:** Each project has its own folder with a README and a necessary dataset to run the program.
- **Diverse in scope:** From data science and analysis to automation to web APIs.
- **A Synthesis Of My Best Work**
